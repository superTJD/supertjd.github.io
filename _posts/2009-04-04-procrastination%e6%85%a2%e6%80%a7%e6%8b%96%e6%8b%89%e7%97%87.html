<p>Procrastination: Ten Things To Know<br />
慢性拖拉症：应该知道的十件事<br />
Is your procrastination hindering you? Ten things you should know.<br />
你的慢性拖拉症在妨碍你吗？这十件事情你应该知道。</p>

<p>There are many ways to avoid success in life, but the most sure-fire just might be procrastination. Procrastinators sabotage themselves. They put obstacles in their own path. They actually choose paths that hurt their performance.<br />
许多方法可以让人无缘成功，拖拉症无疑就是一种。拖拉者妨害自己，给自己设路障，竟然选择危害自己成绩的道路。</p>
<p>Why would people do that? I talked to two of the world's leading experts on procrastination: Joseph Ferrari, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology at De Paul University in Chicago, and <!--more-->Timorthy Pychyl, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. Neither one is a procrastinator, and both answered my many questions immediately.<br />
为什么他们这么做呢？我和两个世界顶级专家一起讨论过拖拉症，他们分别是芝加哥德保尔大学心理学学院的副教授Joseph Ferrari（博士），和渥太华卡尔顿大学心理学学院的副教授Timorthy Pychyl（博士）。他们两个都快速地回答了我大量问题，均不是拖拉症患者。</p>
<p>1. Twenty percent of people identify themselves as chronic procrastinators. For them procrastination is a lifestyle, albeit a maladaptive one. And it cuts across all domains of their life. They don't pay bills on time. They miss opportunities for buying tickets to concerts. They don't cash gift certificates or checks. They file income tax returns late. They leave their Christmas shopping until Christmas eve.<br />
有20%的人确认自己是患慢性拖拉症。对于这些人来说，拖拉是一种生活方式，虽然是一种不良的生活生活。拖拉影响到他们生活的每一个方面：不及时付账单，错失买音乐会门票的时机，不兑现礼品券和现金券，迟迟才申请个人所得税，直到圣诞前夜才去购物。</p>
<p>2. It's not trivial, although as a culture we don't take it seriously as a problem. It represents a profound problem of self-regulation. And there may be more of it in the U.S. than in other countries because we are so nice; we don't call people on their excuses ("my grandmother died last week") even when we don't believe them.<br />
虽然从文化上来讲，这并不是什么严重的问题，但也并非琐事。这是一个深奥的自制力问题。在美国也许会更常见，因为美国人非常“善解人意”，哪怕并不信拖拉者的借口（“我的祖母上周去世了”），也不会责怪他们。</p>
<p>3. Procrastination is not a problem of time management or of planning. Procrastinators are not different in their ability to estimate time, although they are more optimistic than others. "Telling someone who procrastinates to buy a weekly planner is like telling someone with chronic depression to just cheer up," insists Dr. Ferrari.<br />
拖拉症并非是时间管理或计划的问题。尽管拖拉症患者比常人乐观，但他们并非无能估量时间。Ferrari博士坚信：“建议拖拉症患者购买日程薄，就像建议慢性抑郁症患者打起精神一样。”</p>
<p>4. Procrastinators are made not born. Procrastination is learned in the family milieu, but not directly. It is one response to an authoritarian parenting style. Having a harsh, controlling father keeps children from developing the ability to regulate themselves, from internalizing their own intentions and then learning to act on them. Procrastination can even be a form of rebellion, one of the few forms available under such circumstances. What's more, under those household conditions, procrastinators turn more to friends than to parents for support, and their friends may reinforce procrastination because they tend to be tolerant of their excuses.<br />
拖拉症并非是先天的，而是间接从家庭环境中学来的。它是独裁家长作风的产物。严厉又具控制欲的父亲会抑制孩子形成自我控制的能力，使孩子把自己的意愿藏在心里，然后学会与之相处。拖拉症甚至也可能是一种叛逆的表现。这种家长作风会导致叛逆，拖拉症正是其一种表现。而且，在这种家庭环境下，拖拉者更愿意向朋友寻求支持，而不是父母。而朋友会增强拖拉者的拖拉，因为朋友更能容忍他们的借口。</p>
<p>5. Procrastination predicts higher levels of consumption of alcohol among those people who drink. Procrastinators drink more than they intend to—a manifestation of generalized problems in self-regulation. That is over and above the effect of avoidant coping styles that underlie procrastination and lead to disengagement via substance abuse.<br />
拖拉症会使喝酒的人喝得更多。拖拉者比自己想的喝得多——正表示他们自制力有问题。这远远不只是拖拉产生的逃避心理，而是通过酗酒来获得解脱。</p>
<p>6. Procrastinators tell lies to themselves. Such as, "I'll feel more like doing this tomorrow." Or "I work best under pressure." But in fact they do not get the urge the next day or work best under pressure. In addition, they protect their sense of self by saying "this isn't important." Another big lie procrastinators indulge is that time pressure makes them more creative. Unfortunately they do not turn out to be more creative; they only feel that way. They squander their resources.<br />
拖拉者会对自己撒谎。比如说，“我想明天再做这件事”或者“有压力我工作得更好”。但事实上，他们并不会在第二天有急迫感，或者在压力发挥出最好的工作状态。并且，他们通过告诉自己“那并不重要”来保护自己的感觉。拖拉者甚至堕落地撒另一个更大的谎：压力使他们更具有创造力。不幸的是，最后他们并没有显示出更多的创造力，这只是他们自己的感觉而已。他们白费了力气。</p>
<p>7. Procrastinators actively look for distractions, particularly ones that don't take a lot of commitment on their part. Checking e-mail is almost perfect for this purpose. They distract themselves as a way of regulating their emotions such as fear of failure.<br />
拖拉者会积极让自己分心，尤其没什么大任务的时候。最好的方法就是检查邮件。通过使自己分心，可以调节害怕失败的情绪。</p>
<p>8. There's more than one flavor of procrastination. People procrastinate for different reasons. Dr. Ferrari identifies three basic types of procrastinators:<br />
拖拉症不止一个原因，人们为不同的事情拖拉。Ferrari博士认为有三种类型的拖拉者：<br />
arousal types, or thrill-seekers, who wait to the last minute for the euphoric rush.<br />
激进型。他们等到最后一刻，以寻求刺激。<br />
avoiders, who may be avoiding fear of failure or even fear of success, but in either case are very concerned with what others think of them; they would rather have others think they lack effort than ability.<br />
逃避型。他们也许是害怕失败，甚至是害怕成功，但是都非常在意别人对自己的看法。他们情愿别人觉得自己没有努力，而不是缺乏能力。<br />
decisional procrastinators, who cannot make a decision. Not making a decision absolves procrastinators of responsibility for the outcome of events.<br />
犹豫型。他们做不了决定。不能做出决定即是拖拉症的结果，又使拖拉者不能下定决心摆脱拖拉症。</p>
<p>9. There are big costs to procrastination. Health is one. Just over the course of a single academic term, procrastinating college students had such evidence of compromised immune systems as more colds and flu, more gastrointestinal problems. And they had insomnia. In addition, procrastination has a high cost to others as well as oneself; it shifts the burden of responsibilities onto others, who become resentful. Procrastination destroys teamwork in the workplace and private relationships.<br />
拖拉者的代价很大。健康即其一。仅对一个学生小组进行实验，有证据证明，拖拉大学的免疫系统对感冒、发烧和肠胃问题更视而不见。拖拉者还有失眠症。而且，拖拉症不仅对自己有害，也会殃及他人。它使拖拉者把责任推到别人身上，让人感到忿忿不平。拖拉症还会有损工作团队和人际关系。</p>
<p>10. Procrastinators can change their behavior—but doing so consumes a lot of psychic energy. And it doesn't necessarily mean one feels transformed internally. It can be done with highly structured cognitive behavioral therapy.<br />
拖拉者可以改变他们的行为——但是需要很大的精神力。这并不是说一定要发自内心的感到洗心革面。这可以通过有组织的认知行为治疗。</p>
